# Maintenance notes

## Agent / Grok Bot workflow (enforced)

- Default work happens on the agent cloud computer (`/workspace/goblinsrpg3_dev`), not the user's local PC, unless the user explicitly asks for local-machine work.
- Development branch is **`grokbot-dev`**. Push validated work to `grokbot-dev` only.
- **Never** merge to `master` / `main` unless the user explicitly asks.
- When a work chunk is done, always tell the user: (1) what changed, (2) what to test/verify (URLs, commands, slides).
- Use plain `git` for publish operations; do not use `gh` for push.
- If Git reports that `.git` access is denied, stop immediately and ask for permission; do not repeatedly retry or probe `.git\index`.

## Legacy publish notes

- Inspect the worktree and intended scope, then commit intentionally before push.
- Push destination for ongoing agent work: `grokbot-dev` (not `master`).
